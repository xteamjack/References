## NLP Libraries
1. NLTK
   1. String based processing and returns processed strings
   2. Algorithms are more suitable for Researchers than developers
   3. NLTK outperforms spaCy in sentence tokenization.
   4. NLTK comes with good pre-created models
2. SpaCy
   1. Object oriented, returns processed objects
   2. Slightly written in Cython, faster than NLTK. However a memory Hog
   3. Latest techniques and improved algorithms over NLTK
   4. Supports over  75 languages, including English, German, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, and Greek
   5. spaCy performs better than NLTK in word tokenization and part-of-speech tagging
   6. 
3. BERT
