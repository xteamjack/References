## SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)
SQuAD is a widely used dataset for evaluating machine comprehension of text. It consists of passages from Wikipedia and a set of questions, with answers directly derived from the passages. This makes it suitable for single-context question answering tasks.

Eg: 
Passage: "Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity."
Question: "Who developed the theory of relativity?"
Answer: "Albert Einstein"

## HotPotQA
HotPotQA is designed to assess multi-hop reasoning across multiple documents. It requires models to connect information from multiple sources to answer complex questions, making it more challenging than single-context datasets like SQuAD.
